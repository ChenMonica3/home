			<h2>Artist Biography</h2>
			<p>K&auml;&auml;rij&auml; was raised in the Ruskeasanta suburb of Vantaa, Greater Helsinki. 
			While learning to play the drums, he realised his love for music, and he began making songs 
			in 2014. His stage name, which was inspired by his love of gambling, is k&auml;&auml;ri&auml; 
			rahaa, which means "to make a quick buck".

			<h2>Song and Performance Review</h2>
			<p> Prior to the performance, I knew this was a really popular song among the fandom. However, this song is just not the kind of 
			music that I personally like. The whole performance is amazing, with the interactive box breaking moments, giant background shadow,
			and fantastic background dancers. Even with the production trying to mute them as much as possible, you can still hear the audience chanting
			"Cha Cha Cha" along with the singer. This really showed how liked this song was across the fandom, and it was proven in the televote
			results. With a shockingly low jury points score, I couldn't predict if the televotes could boost him with enough points for him to win. Unfortunately, Loreen
			had too much of a lead in the jury votes, even with "Cha Cha Cha" scoring the second most jury votes in the entire history of Eurovision.
