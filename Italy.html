			<h2>Artist Biography</h2>
			<p>On December 25, 1988, Marco Mengoni was born in Ronciglione. He began taking singing lessons 
			when he was 14 years old and enrolled in a high school course for industrial design. Later, 
			he began to perform with a five-piece vocal ensemble. He relocated to Rome after finishing 
			high school and enrolled in a language programme there. He occasionally worked as a barman 
			when he was in school and sang at weddings and piano bars.

			<h2>Song and Performance Review</h2>
			<p>My first impression of this song was that it's a beautiful change from the high tempo pop songs that are
			usually present at Eurovision. During the performance, I'm honestly just watching the dancers in the background and
			how they seamlessly fall off the stars, only to be trampolined back up. The smoke that is gently moving around really adds to the 
			mystical feel of the song. The singer has amazing vocals and I am pleased
			to see the audience waving around their phone flashlights in the background.
