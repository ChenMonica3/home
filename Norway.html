		<h3>Artist Biography</h3>
		<p>
		Alessandra was born on September 5, 2002, to an Italian father from Albenga and a Norwegian mother from 
		Stathelle in Pietra Ligure, Savona. She was raised in Cisano sul Neva and she won the fifth season of 
		VB Factor, a regional talent competition in the Val Bormida area, when she was twelve years old. She 
		moved in with her maternal grandparents in Porsgrunn, Norway, after graduating from high school in 2021, 
		then she relocated to Lillehammer to attend the "Lillehammer Institute of Music Production and Industries."

		<h3>Song and Performance Review</h3>
		<p>The background vocals at the beginning of the song really give this an ethereal feel,
		like you're about to listen to the greatest folklore story of all time. This sort of mysterious feeling continues until the chorus,
		where you can see four backup dancers appearing from the shadows. The chorus is no doubt very catchy, which definitely adds
		to the popularity of the song and it's no wonder this song won Norway's National Finals, Melodi Grand Prix 2023. Right before the second
		chorus, at about 1:47 in the video, there is such a seamless removal of the cape. The performance by the backup dancers with the glowing sticks
		during the second chorus is also a nice touch that really blends in with the stage lighting. She really knows how to effectively use
		the technology provided, especially in the moment when the floor lights up in flames around her. As for the message, I believe the song to be about empowering women in the format of an old folktale and legend.
		Overall, I enjoy this song and I do listen to it occasionally. I think that the jury gave less points than I was expecting them to but
		I'm glad this song got as many televote points as it did.
