		<h3>Artist Biography</h3>
		<p>
		Loreen was born to Moroccan immigrants in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1983. In her early years, 
		Loreen relocated to VÃ¤ster's. Her hometown is where she spent her formative years.She spent 
		the majority of her teenage years in the city's Gryta neighbourhood. This is her second time at Eurovision, as she won the 2012 edition
		with the song <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfo-8z86x80">Euphoria</a>.

		<h3>Song and Performance Review</h3>
		<p>The background vocals at the beginning of the song really give this an ethereal feel,
		like you're about to listen to the greatest folklore story of all time. This sort of mysterious feeling continues until the chorus,
		where you can see four backup dancers appearing from the shadows. The chorus is no doubt very catchy, which definitely adds
		to the popularity of the song and it's no wonder this song won Norway's National Finals, Melodi Grand Prix 2023. Right before the second
		chorus, at about 1:47 in the video, there is such a seamless removal of the cape. The performance by the backup dancers with the glowing sticks
		during the second chorus is also a nice touch that really blends in with the stage lighting. She really knows how to effectively use
		the technology provided, especially in the moment when the floor lights up in flames around her. As for the message, I believe the song to be about empowering women in the format of an old folktale and legend.
		Overall, I enjoy this song and I do listen to it occasionally. I think that the jury gave less points than I was expecting them to but
		I'm glad this song got as many televote points as it did.
