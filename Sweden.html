			<h2>Artist Biography</h2>
			<p>
			Loreen was born to Moroccan immigrants in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1983. In her early years, 
			Loreen relocated to V&auml;ster's. Her hometown is where she spent her formative years. She spent 
			the majority of her teenage years in the city's Gryta neighbourhood. This is her second time at Eurovision, as she won the 2012 edition
			with the song <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pfo-8z86x80">Euphoria</a>.

			<h2>Song and Performance Review</h2>
			<p>
			Of course, when talking about Loreen's performance, it's hard to ignore her outstanding performance at Eurovision 2012. She set
			the bar so high for herself that I was wondering what she could do this time to surprise everyone. Immediately, you can notice the giant
			"panini press", as the audience has dubbed it, that she's in. Her vocals are just immaculate as always and even without big physical performances,
			she knows how to capture an audience. Her movements are carefully rehearsed and prepared, yet they feel like spur of the moment actions
			from the sheer, raw emotions of the song. Like in her 2012 performance, she stays in a relatively small area on the stage. After this performance, I
			was team Loreen for the win. When they kept calling out twelve points after twelve points in the jury voting section, I knew that many
			other people felt the same way. This is why I wasn't surprised when she won, becoming the second performer ever to win this competition
			more than once.
