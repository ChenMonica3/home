			<h2>Artist Biography</h2>

			Austria, while her mother's family is Moroccan-Jewish. Her father is the chief executive 
			officer of Glassco Glass, an imported-glass company. Her mother runs an upscale clothing boutique.

			<h2>Song and Performance Review</h2>
			<p>At the beginning of the song, I enjoy the effect that was created by the lights in the box. I also find it
			impressive how she can sing and perform a dance at the same time. The background dancers definitely add to the performance but
			I really liked when they left during the beginning dance break by the singer and then came back to perform my favourite dance moment
			of this years' show. However, I find the lyrics to be slightly rudimentary for a song contest. I was shocked when I saw this receive
			as many televote points as it did, with Israel being a controversial place at this moment.
