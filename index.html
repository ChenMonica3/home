			<h2>What is Eurovision?</h2>
			<p>Eurovision is a song contest that was started in 1956 and has been held annually 
			ever since. Each country involved sends a representative to perform. This representative 
			is usually selected during a country's national finals, where a jury and the audience of 
			the specific country vote for their favourite song and performance. The winner of the 
			previous year is usually the country that hosts the show, but because of the ongoing 
			war in Ukraine, the country whose representatives won Eurovision 2022 chose Liverpool as 
			the host city instead this year. This year had a total of 37 countries participating, which 
			is less than usual due to the high costs of sending a representative and concerns with global
			warming and carbon emissions involved with sending a performer. This show is a celebration
			of European culture, music, and pride, and the performances are nothing short of incredible. </p>

			<h2>How do countries make it to the finals?</h2>
			<p>Before the finals of Eurovision, there are two semi-finals that take place. These occur 
			4 and 2 days before the finals, respectively, and every single country that competes in Eurovision 
			except for the Big 5 must compete in these semi-finals for a spot in the finals. In the past, 
			the jury and the audience used to have a 50/50 split on the points for the semi-finals. However, 
			this year, the production behind Eurovision got rid of jury votes for the semi-finals. On the 
			other hand, who are the Big 5? Well, the Big 5 consists of Germany, France, the United Kingdom, 
			Italy, and Spain. These countries contribute the most financially to the production of Eurovision
			and bring in the most viewers, so they automatically get a pass to the finals without having to 
			compete in the semi-finals. Unfortunately, the side effect of this is that countries in the Big 5 
			often do poorly in the competition..</p>

			<h2>How does the points system work?</h2>
			<p>First, there is the jury system. Each country involved in Eurovision has a small jury, usually 
			of a few people, that decides where they would like to allocate their country's points. A country 
			can give at most 12 points, followed by 10, and then 8 all the way to 1. Secondly, there is the 
			televote. This is where citizens can vote for their favourite songs, with a maximum of 20 votes 
			per phone number. This year, they added a new "Rest of the World" voting system. This allows anyone 
			who lives outside of Europe to vote as well, with their total votes having the same weight as those 
			of one European country. This is to expand the international possibilities of the show, with the 
			televote also following the same 12, 10, 8-1 points system as the jury. </p>

			<h2>My overall opinion of the results</h2>
			<p>Before the show, I looked at many online predictions on who was going to win, 
			and I found that a large majority of people were rooting for Sweden to win. I figured
			this was due to the performer's winning Eurovision 2012 performance. However, I also
			found a cult following surrounding Finland's entry. When I first listened to it, I didn't 
			really enjoy it or understand the hype that was being built. But over time, I slightly 
			understood why this song got as many televote points as it did. Personally, I am 
			surprised to see France's and Portugal's performances so low on the list. Before the show, 
			I believed they would be frontrunners in the competition. Furthermore, I was shocked to see 
			Croatia get as many points as it did. I understand that not all performances have to be serious, 
			but the whole show that the performers put on was quite erratic and hard to follow. In the 
			semi-finals, I think that Georgia should've qualified over Poland. Overall, this year brought 
			many talented performers and performances, and I cannot wait to see what's in store next year.</p>
